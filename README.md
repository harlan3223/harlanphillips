### Hello!

My name is Harlan, I'm a dedicated Computer Engineering student at Bakersfield College on a path with aspirations to transfer to a top-tier university such as UC Berkeley. Currently, I'm gaining hands-on experience as an intern at NASA, where I'm diving deep into data science for space exploration. I love experimenting with machine learning and coding in python/swift.
